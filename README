Barnes & Hut orbital simulator in Haskell

Made by Morten Olsen Lysgaard

You need:
* ghc
* ffmpeg
* imagemagik

to build, run: ghc --make Main.hs

After that you can open simulate.sh and edit it for your location.
Then run simulate.sh.

The binary, Main creates a series of SVG files displaying the planets.
Then, a imagemagik, ffmpeg magic turns it intoo a video.

This was created because I was bored during a flu/fever in my summer vacation 2011.

Have fun!
